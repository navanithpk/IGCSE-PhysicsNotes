\subsection*{Question 1}

To find the volume of the irregularly shaped piece of metal, the student can use the water displacement method. Here are the steps:

1. **Fill the measuring cylinder with a known volume of water.** Record the initial water level.
2. **Carefully lower the metal piece into the measuring cylinder.** Make sure the metal is completely submerged in water and no air bubbles are trapped. 
3. **Record the new water level.** The difference between the initial and final water levels represents the volume of the metal. 

\subsection*{Question 2}

The measuring device uses mercury instead of colored water because **mercury has a much higher density than water**. This means that a mercury column will rise to a much shorter height than a water column for the same pressure.  This makes the measuring device more compact and easier to read.

\subsection*{Question 3}

Density is defined as mass per unit volume. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}$$

Given:

* Mass of the block ($m$) = 70 kg
* Volume of the block ($V$) = 0.0089 m$^3$

Substituting these values into the formula:

$$\text{density} = \frac{70 \text{ kg}}{0.0089 \text{ m}^3} = \textbf{7865.17 kg/m$^3$} $$

\subsection*{Question 4}

\textbf{(a) Mass of Water}

Given:

* Volume of water ($V$) = 500 cm$^3$ = 0.0005 m$^3$ (1 cm$^3$ = 10$^{-6}$ m$^3$)
* Density of water ($\rho$) = 1000 kg/m$^3$

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Rearranging to solve for mass:

$$m = \rho V$$

Substituting the values:

$$m = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 0.0005 \text{ m}^3 = \textbf{0.5 kg}$$

\textbf{(b) Energy Given Out}

The total energy given out as the water cools from 5.0 °C to ice at -18.0 °C can be calculated in three steps:

1. **Energy given out as the water cools from 5.0 °C to 0.0 °C:**

$$E_1 = mc\Delta T$$

where:

* $m$ = mass of water = 0.5 kg
* $c$ = specific heat capacity of water = 4200 J/(kg °C)
* $\Delta T$ = change in temperature = 5.0 °C 

$$E_1 = 0.5 \text{ kg} \times 4200 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 5.0 \text{ °C} = 10500 \text{ J}$$

2. **Energy given out as the water freezes at 0.0 °C:**

$$E_2 = mL$$

where:

* $L$ = specific latent heat of fusion of water = 3.3 × 10$^5$ J/kg

$$E_2 = 0.5 \text{ kg} \times 3.3 \times 10^5 \text{ J/kg} = 165000 \text{ J}$$

3. **Energy given out as the ice cools from 0.0 °C to -18.0 °C:**

$$E_3 = mc\Delta T$$

where:

* $c$ = specific heat capacity of ice = 2100 J/(kg °C)
* $\Delta T$ = change in temperature = 18.0 °C

$$E_3 = 0.5 \text{ kg} \times 2100 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 18.0 \text{ °C} = 18900 \text{ J}$$

The total energy given out is the sum of these three energies:

$$\text{Total energy} = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 10500 \text{ J} + 165000 \text{ J} + 18900 \text{ J} = \textbf{194400 J}$$

\subsection*{Question 5}

To determine the density of the liquid using the given equipment, the student can follow these steps:

1. **Measure the mass of the empty measuring cylinder using the balance.** Record this mass as $m_1$.
2. **Pour some of the liquid into the measuring cylinder.** Record the volume of the liquid as $V$.
3. **Measure the mass of the measuring cylinder with the liquid using the balance.** Record this mass as $m_2$.
4. **Calculate the mass of the liquid ($m$)** by subtracting the mass of the empty cylinder from the mass of the cylinder with the liquid: $m = m_2 - m_1$.
5. **Calculate the density of the liquid ($\rho$)** using the formula: 
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

\subsection*{Question 6}

\textbf{(a) Density of Metal}

Given:

* Mass of the metal block ($m$) = 86 g
* Volume of the metal block ($V$) = 8.0 cm$^3$

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Substituting the values:

$$\rho = \frac{86 \text{ g}}{8.0 \text{ cm}^3} = \textbf{10.75 g/cm$^3$} $$

\textbf{(b) Density of Liquid}

For the metal block to float on the liquid, the density of the liquid must be greater than the density of the metal block. Therefore, a possible value for the density of the liquid could be any value greater than 10.75 g/cm$^3$.

\subsection*{Question 7}

\textbf{(a) Mass of Sand}

Given:

* Volume of sand ($V$) = 0.050 m$^3$
* Density of sand ($\rho$) = 1900 kg/m$^3$

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Rearranging to solve for mass:

$$m = \rho V$$

Substituting the values:

$$m = 1900 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 0.050 \text{ m}^3 = \textbf{95 kg}$$

\textbf{(b) Thermal Capacity of Sand}

The thermal capacity of a substance is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a given mass of the substance by 1 degree Celsius. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$\text{thermal capacity} = mc$$

where:

* $m$ = mass of the substance
* $c$ = specific heat capacity of the substance

Given:

* Mass of sand ($m$) = 95 kg (calculated in part (a))
* Specific heat capacity of sand ($c$) = 1500 J/(kg °C)

Substituting these values into the formula:

$$\text{thermal capacity} = 95 \text{ kg} \times 1500 \text{ J/(kg °C)} = \textbf{142500 J/°C}$$

\subsection*{Question 8}

Given:

* Mass of the stone ($m$) = 98.4 g
* Volume of the stone ($V$) = 41.0 cm$^3$

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Substituting the values:

$$\rho = \frac{98.4 \text{ g}}{41.0 \text{ cm}^3} = \textbf{2.40 g/cm$^3$} $$

\subsection*{Question 9}

The volume of the stone can be determined by finding the difference in water levels before and after the stone is lowered into the measuring cylinder. 

Looking at the diagram, the initial water level is 30 cm$^3$ and the final water level is 54 cm$^3$.

Therefore, the volume of the stone is:

$$\text{volume} = 54 \text{ cm}^3 - 30 \text{ cm}^3 = \textbf{24 cm$^3$} $$

\subsection*{Question 10}

1. **Volume of the metal block:**  The volume of the metal block will \textbf{increase} when its temperature increases. This is because thermal expansion causes the particles in the metal to vibrate more vigorously, leading to an increase in the average distance between them.
2. **Mass of the metal block:** The mass of the metal block will \textbf{remain constant}.  Heating the metal block does not change the number of atoms in the block, so its mass remains the same.
3. **Density of the metal block:** The density of the metal block will \textbf{decrease}. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. Since the mass remains constant while the volume increases, the density will decrease.

\subsection*{Question 11}

\textbf{(a) Mass of Liquid}

Given:

* Mass of the empty beaker = 400 g
* Mass of the beaker with the liquid = 1100 g

The mass of the liquid can be calculated by subtracting the mass of the empty beaker from the mass of the beaker with the liquid:

$$\text{mass of liquid} = 1100 \text{ g} - 400 \text{ g} = \textbf{700 g}$$

\textbf{(b) Density of Liquid}

Given:

* Volume of liquid ($V$) = 750 cm$^3$
* Mass of liquid ($m$) = 700 g (calculated in part (a))

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Substituting the values:

$$\rho = \frac{700 \text{ g}}{750 \text{ cm}^3} = \textbf{0.93 g/cm$^3$} $$

\subsection*{Question 12}

Given:

* Volume of wire ($V$) = 16.6 cm$^3$
* Mass of wire ($m$) = 148 g

Using the formula for density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Substituting the values:

$$\rho = \frac{148 \text{ g}}{16.6 \text{ cm}^3} = \textbf{8.92 g/cm$^3$} $$
