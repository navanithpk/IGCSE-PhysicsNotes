<h1>Solutions to Physics Questions</h1>

<div>
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>A student has a measuring cylinder and a small, irregularly shaped piece of metal. The piece of
metal can easily fit into the measuring cylinder. <br>
Describe how the student can use the measuring cylinder and some water to find the volume of
the metal.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
1. Pour some water into the measuring cylinder and record the volume of the water. <br>
2. Carefully lower the piece of metal into the water, ensuring it is fully submerged and no air bubbles are trapped. <br>
3. Record the new volume of the water. <br>
4. The volume of the metal is the difference between the two volume readings.

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>A device for measuring gas pressure is connected to a gas supply as shown in the diagram. <br>
<img src="1.4_v1_2.png" alt="Diagram 1.4_v1_2"> <br>
Suggest why this measuring device uses mercury rather than coloured water.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Mercury is much denser than water, so a shorter column of mercury is needed to measure the same pressure as a taller column of water. This allows for a more compact and practical measuring device.

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>The volume of a block is 0.0089 m<sup>3</sup>. The mass of the block is 70 kg. <br>
Calculate the density of the block. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{70 \text{ kg}}{0.0089 \text{ m}^3} = \boxed{7900 \text{ kg/m}^3}$$
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>A bowl contains 500 cm<sup>3</sup> of water at a temperature of 5.0 °C. The bowl of water is placed in a freezer for several hours. When the bowl is removed from the freezer, it contains ice at a temperature of –18.0 °C. The density of water is 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the mass of water in the bowl when it is placed in the freezer.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
First, convert the volume of water from cm<sup>3</sup> to m<sup>3</sup>: 
 $$500 \text{ cm}^3 = 500 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3 = 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3$$
 Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
 $$m = \rho V = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3 = \boxed{0.50 \text{ kg}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg °C). The specific heat capacity of ice is 2100 J/(kg °C). The specific latent heat of fusion of water is 3.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> J/kg. <br>
Calculate the energy given out as the water cools from 5.0 °C to ice at –18.0 °C.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The energy given out can be calculated in three steps:
1. **Cooling the water from 5.0 °C to 0 °C:**
    *  Using the equation for energy transfer during temperature change, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, *c* is specific heat capacity, and *ΔT* is the change in temperature:
    $$Q_1 = mcΔT = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 4200 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (5.0 - 0) \text{ °C} = 10500 \text{ J}$$
2. **Freezing the water at 0 °C:**
    * Using the equation for energy transfer during a change of state, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, and *L* is the specific latent heat:
    $$Q_2 = mL = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 3.3 \times 10^5 \text{ J/kg} = 165000 \text{ J}$$
3. **Cooling the ice from 0 °C to –18.0 °C:**
    *  Using the equation for energy transfer during temperature change, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, *c* is specific heat capacity, and *ΔT* is the change in temperature:
    $$Q_3 = mcΔT = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 2100 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (0 - (-18.0)) \text{ °C} = 18900 \text{ J}$$
Therefore, the total energy given out is:
$$Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = 10500 \text{ J} + 165000 \text{ J} + 18900 \text{ J} = \boxed{194400 \text{ J}}$$

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>A student has a measuring cylinder, a beaker of liquid and a balance. <br>
Describe how the student can use this equipment to determine the density of the liquid.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
1. **Measure the mass of the empty beaker:** Place the empty beaker on the balance and record its mass. <br>
2. **Pour some liquid into the beaker:** Pour some of the liquid from the beaker into the measuring cylinder and record its volume. <br>
3. **Measure the mass of the beaker and liquid:** Place the beaker with the liquid on the balance and record its mass. <br>
4. **Calculate the mass of the liquid:** Subtract the mass of the empty beaker from the mass of the beaker and liquid. <br>
5. **Calculate the density of the liquid:** Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume, divide the mass of the liquid by its volume.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Question 6</h2>
<p>A metal block has a mass of 86 g and a volume of 8.0 cm<sup>3</sup>. </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the density *ρ* of the metal using the equation.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{86 \text{ g}}{8.0 \text{ cm}^3} = \boxed{10.75 \text{ g/cm}^3}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** The metal block is placed in some liquid. The metal block floats on the liquid. <br>
Suggest a value for the density of the liquid.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
For the metal block to float on the liquid, the density of the liquid must be greater than the density of the metal block. Therefore, a possible value for the density of the liquid is **11 g/cm<sup>3</sup>**. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Question 7</h2>
<p>A sample of sand has a volume of 0.050 m<sup>3</sup>. The density of the sand is 1900 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The specific heat capacity of the sand is 1500 J/(kg °C). </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the mass of the sample of sand.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$m = \rho V = 1900 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 0.050 \text{ m}^3 = \boxed{95 \text{ kg}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** Calculate the thermal capacity of the sample of sand.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for thermal capacity, where *C* is thermal capacity, *m* is mass, and *c* is specific heat capacity:
$$C = mc = 95 \text{ kg} \times 1500 \text{ J/(kg °C)} = \boxed{142500 \text{ J/°C}}$$
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Question 8</h2>
<p>A stone has a mass of 98.4 g. The volume of this stone is 41.0 cm<sup>3</sup>. <br>
Calculate the density of the stone.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{98.4 \text{ g}}{41.0 \text{ cm}^3} = \boxed{2.40 \text{ g/cm}^3}$$
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Question 9</h2>
<p>The diagram shows a measuring cylinder before and after having a stone lowered into it. <br>
<img src="1.4_v1_9.png" alt="Diagram 1.4_v1_9"> <br>
Calculate the volume of the stone.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The volume of the stone is the difference between the initial volume of water and the final volume of water after the stone was submerged.
$$\text{volume} = 55 \text{ cm}^3 - 40 \text{ cm}^3 = \boxed{15 \text{ cm}^3}$$
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>1. the volume of the metal block</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The volume of the metal block **increases**.
</p>
<p>2. the mass of the metal block</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The mass of the metal block **stays the same**.
</p>
<p>3. the density of the metal block</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The density of the metal block **decreases**.
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>The diagram shows a beaker containing liquid on a top pan balance. <br>
<img src="1.4_v1_11.png" alt="Diagram 1.4_v1_11"> <br>
The mass of the empty beaker is 400 g. </p>
<p>**(a)** Using the information in the diagram, determine the mass of the liquid in the beaker. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
$$\text{mass} = 650 \text{ g} - 400 \text{ g} = \boxed{250 \text{ g}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** The beaker contains 750 cm<sup>3</sup> of liquid. <br>
Calculate the density of the liquid.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{250 \text{ g}}{750 \text{ cm}^3} = \boxed{0.33 \text{ g/cm}^3}$$
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>The diagram shows a coil of wire. <br>
<img src="1.4_v1_12.png" alt="Diagram 1.4_v1_12"> <br>
(not to scale) <br>
The volume of the wire in the coil is 16.6 cm<sup>3</sup> and its mass is 148 g. <br>
Calculate the density of the metal used for the wire in the coil.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{148 \text{ g}}{16.6 \text{ cm}^3} = \boxed{8.92 \text{ g/cm}^3}$$
