                <p><p>A student has a measuring cylinder and a small, irregularly shaped piece of metal. The piece of
metal can easily fit into the measuring cylinder. <br>
Describe how the student can use the measuring cylinder and some water to find the volume of
the metal.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
1. Pour some water into the measuring cylinder and record the volume of the water. <br>
2. Carefully lower the piece of metal into the water, ensuring it is fully submerged and no air bubbles are trapped. <br>
3. Record the new volume of the water. <br>
4. The volume of the metal is the difference between the two volume readings.

                <p><p>A device for measuring gas pressure is connected to a gas supply as shown in the diagram. <br>
<img src="1.4_v1_2.png" alt="Diagram 1.4_v1_2"> <br>
Suggest why this measuring device uses mercury rather than coloured water.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Mercury is much denser than water, so a shorter column of mercury is needed to measure the same pressure as a taller column of water. This allows for a more compact and practical measuring device.

Calculate the density of the block. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{70 \text{ kg}}{0.0089 \text{ m}^3} = \boxed{7900 \text{ kg/m}^3}$$

                <p><p>A bowl contains 500 cm<sup>3</sup> of water at a temperature of 5.0 °C. The bowl of water is placed in a freezer for several hours. When the bowl is removed from the freezer, it contains ice at a temperature of –18.0 °C. The density of water is 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the mass of water in the bowl when it is placed in the freezer.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
First, convert the volume of water from cm<sup>3</sup> to m<sup>3</sup>: 
 $$500 \text{ cm}^3 = 500 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3 = 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3$$
 Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
 $$m = \rho V = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3 = \boxed{0.50 \text{ kg}}$$

                <p><p>**(b)** The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg °C). The specific heat capacity of ice is 2100 J/(kg °C). The specific latent heat of fusion of water is 3.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> J/kg. <br>
Calculate the energy given out as the water cools from 5.0 °C to ice at –18.0 °C.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The energy given out can be calculated in three steps:
1. **Cooling the water from 5.0 °C to 0 °C:**
    *  Using the equation for energy transfer during temperature change, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, *c* is specific heat capacity, and *ΔT* is the change in temperature:
    $$Q_1 = mcΔT = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 4200 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (5.0 - 0) \text{ °C} = 10500 \text{ J}$$
2. **Freezing the water at 0 °C:**
    * Using the equation for energy transfer during a change of state, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, and *L* is the specific latent heat:
    $$Q_2 = mL = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 3.3 \times 10^5 \text{ J/kg} = 165000 \text{ J}$$
3. **Cooling the ice from 0 °C to –18.0 °C:**
    *  Using the equation for energy transfer during temperature change, where *Q* is energy, *m* is mass, *c* is specific heat capacity, and *ΔT* is the change in temperature:
    $$Q_3 = mcΔT = 0.50 \text{ kg} \times 2100 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (0 - (-18.0)) \text{ °C} = 18900 \text{ J}$$
Therefore, the total energy given out is:
$$Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = 10500 \text{ J} + 165000 \text{ J} + 18900 \text{ J} = \boxed{194400 \text{ J}}$$

<p>**(a)** Calculate the density *ρ* of the metal using the equation.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{86 \text{ g}}{8.0 \text{ cm}^3} = \boxed{10.75 \text{ g/cm}^3}$$

For the metal block to float on the liquid, the density of the liquid must be greater than the density of the metal block. Therefore, a possible value for the density of the liquid is **11 g/cm<sup>3</sup>**.

Using the equation for density, where *ρ* is density, *m* is mass and *V* is volume:
