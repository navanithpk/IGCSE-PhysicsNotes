<h1>Solutions to Motion Questions</h1>

<div>
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>The diagram shows a boat stored in a shed. The boat is suspended from the ceiling of the shed by two ropes. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_1.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_1"> <br>
The tension T in each of the ropes is 75N. </p>
<p>**(a)** Draw a vector diagram to determine the resultant of the forces exerted by the two ropes on the boat. State the scale you used. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
scale = 1 cm represents 25 N <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_ans_1.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_ans_1"> <br>
magnitude of resultant force = **130 N** <br>
direction of resultant force = **vertically upwards**
</p>
<p>**(b)** Determine the mass of the boat. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The boat is in equilibrium, so the resultant force is equal to the weight of the boat. <br>
Using the equation for weight, where *W* is weight, *m* is mass and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity:
$$W = mg$$
Rearranging the equation to solve for mass:
$$m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{130 \text{ N}}{10 \text{ N/kg}} = \boxed{13 \text{ kg}}$$
</p>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>The diagram shows a uniform rod of wood suspended from a pivot. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_2.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_2"> <br>
(not to scale) <br>
The rod is held stationary by a horizontal force F acting as shown. <br>
The mass of the rod is 0.080kg. </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the weight W of the rod.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for weight, where *W* is weight, *m* is mass and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity:
$$W = mg = 0.080 \text{ kg} \times 10 \text{ N/kg} = \boxed{0.80 \text{ N}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** Calculate the moment of W about the pivot.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The moment of a force about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point. 
$$ \text{moment} = \text{force} \times \text{perpendicular distance} = 0.80 \text{ N} \times 0.40 \text{ m} = \boxed{0.32 \text{ Nm}}$$
</p>
<p>**(c)** Calculate the moment of F about the pivot. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
As the rod is in equilibrium, the clockwise moment produced by the force *F* is equal to the anticlockwise moment produced by the weight *W*. <br>
Therefore: <br>
$$ \text{moment of F} = \boxed{0.32 \text{ Nm}}$$
</p>
<p>**(d)** Calculate the force F. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The moment of a force about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point. 
Rearranging the equation to solve for the force:
$$ \text{force} = \frac{\text{moment}}{\text{perpendicular distance}} = \frac{0.32 \text{ Nm}}{0.80 \text{ m}} = \boxed{0.40 \text{ N}}$$

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>A sky-diver jumps out of a hot-air balloon, which is 4000m above the ground. At time = 30s, she opens her parachute. <br>
The graph is the speed-time graph of her fall. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_3.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_3"> </p>
<p>Describe, in terms of the forces acting on the sky-diver, her motion between leaving the balloon and opening her parachute.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
Initially, the only force acting on the skydiver is her **weight**, which causes her to **accelerate downwards**. As her speed increases, the **air resistance** acting on her also increases, opposing her motion. This causes her acceleration to **decrease** until the air resistance becomes equal to her weight. At this point, the forces are balanced, and she reaches **terminal velocity**, falling at a constant speed. 
</p>

<div>
<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>The diagram shows a sign that extends over a road. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_4.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_4"> <br>
The mass of the sign is 3.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> kg. </p>
<p>**(a)** Calculate the weight W of the sign. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for weight, where *W* is weight, *m* is mass and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity:
$$ W = mg = 3.4 \times 10^3 \text{ kg} \times 10 \text{ N/kg} = \boxed{3.4 \times 10^4 \text{ N}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b) (i)** The weight of the sign acts at a horizontal distance of 1.8m from the centre of the support post and it produces a turning effect about point P. <br>
Point P is a horizontal distance of 1.3m from the centre of the support post. <br>
Calculate the moment about P due to the weight of the sign. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The moment of a force about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point. 
$$ \text{moment} = \text{force} \times \text{perpendicular distance} = 3.4 \times 10^4 \text{ N} \times (1.8 \text{ m} + 1.3 \text{ m}) = \boxed{1.05 \times 10^5 \text{ Nm}}$$
</p>
<p>**(ii)** A concrete block is positioned on the other side of the support post with its centre of mass a horizontal distance of 70cm from the centre of the support post. <br>
State what is meant by centre of mass.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
The **centre of mass** of an object is the point at which the entire weight of the object appears to act. 
</p>
<p>**(iii)** The weight of the concrete block produces a moment about point P that exactly cancels the moment caused by the weight W. <br>
Calculate the weight of the concrete block.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
As the moments caused by the sign and the concrete block cancel each other out, the magnitudes of the moments are equal.
The moment of a force about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point. 
Rearranging the equation to solve for the weight of the concrete block:
$$ \text{weight} = \frac{\text{moment}}{\text{perpendicular distance}} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^5 \text{ Nm}}{0.70 \text{ m}} = \boxed{1.50 \times 10^5 \text{ N}}$$
</p>
<p>**(c)** The concrete block is removed. The sign and support post rotate about point P in a clockwise direction. <br>
State and explain what happens to the moment about point P due to the weight of the sign as it rotates. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The moment of the sign **increases** as it rotates. This is because the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the weight of the sign and point P **increases** as the sign rotates.

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>The diagram shows a hollow metal cylinder containing air, floating in the sea. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_5.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_5"> <br>
The density of the metal used to make the cylinder is greater than the density of seawater. </p>
<p>**(a)** Explain why the cylinder floats. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The cylinder floats because it displaces a volume of water whose weight is equal to the weight of the cylinder.
</p>
<p>**(b)** The cylinder has a length of 1.8m. It floats with 1.2m submerged in the sea. The bottom of the cylinder has an area of cross-section of 0.80m<sup>2</sup>. <br>
The density of seawater is 1020kg /m<sup>3</sup>. <br>
Calculate the force exerted on the bottom of the cylinder due to the depth of the seawater. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The force exerted on the bottom of the cylinder due to the depth of the seawater is equal to the pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the bottom of the cylinder. <br>
Using the equation for pressure, where *P* is pressure, *ρ* is density of the liquid, *g* is the acceleration due to gravity, and *h* is the depth: 
$$ P = \rho gh = 1020 \text{ kg/m}^3 \times 10 \text{ N/kg} \times 1.2 \text{ m} = 1.22 \times 10^4 \text{ Pa}$$ <br>
Therefore, the force exerted on the bottom of the cylinder is: 
$$ \text{force} = \text{pressure} \times \text{area} = 1.22 \times 10^4 \text{ Pa} \times 0.80 \text{ m}^2 = \boxed{9800 \text{ N}}$$
</p>
<p>**(c)** Deduce the weight of the cylinder. Explain your answer. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The cylinder is in equilibrium, so the upward force exerted by the water is equal to the weight of the cylinder. <br>
Therefore, the weight of the cylinder is: 
$$ \text{weight} = \boxed{9800 \text{ N}}$$
</p>

<h2>Question 6</h2>
<p>A rectangular container has a base of dimensions 0.12m × 0.16m. The container is filled with a liquid. The mass of the liquid in the container is 4.8 kg. </p>
<p>**(a) (i)** Calculate the weight of liquid in the container. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for weight, where *W* is weight, *m* is mass and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity:
$$ W = mg = 4.8 \text{ kg} \times 10 \text{ N/kg} = \boxed{48 \text{ N}}$$
</p>
<p>**(ii)** Calculate the pressure due to the liquid on the base of the container. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for pressure, where *P* is pressure, *F* is the force, and *A* is the area: 
$$P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{48 \text{ N}}{0.12 \text{ m} \times 0.16 \text{ m}} = \boxed{2500 \text{ Pa}}$$
</p>
<p>**(b)** Explain why the total pressure on the base of the container is greater than the value calculated in (a)(ii). </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The total pressure on the base of the container is greater than the pressure due to the liquid because it also includes the **atmospheric pressure** acting on the surface of the liquid.
</p>
<p>**(c)** The depth of liquid in the container is 0.32m. <br>
Calculate the density of the liquid. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
Using the equation for pressure, where *P* is pressure, *ρ* is density of the liquid, *g* is the acceleration due to gravity, and *h* is the depth: 
$$ P = \rho gh $$
Rearranging the equation to solve for the density:
$$\rho = \frac{P}{gh} = \frac{2500 \text{ Pa}}{10 \text{ N/kg} \times 0.32 \text{ m}} = \boxed{780 \text{ kg/m}^3}$$

<h2>Question 7</h2>
<p>There is no atmosphere on the Moon. <br>
A space probe is launched from the surface of the Moon. The graph is a speed-time graph of the space probe. <br>
<img src="1.3_v1_6.png" alt="Diagram 1.3_v1_6"> </p>
<p>**(a)** Between time = 0 and time = 150s, the acceleration of the space probe changes. <br>
Without calculation, state how the graph shows this. </p>
<p style="display: none;">
The graph shows that the acceleration is changing because the **gradient** of the line is **changing**.
</p>
<p>**(b)** Between time = 0 and time = 150s, the thrust exerted on the space probe by the motor remains constant. <br>
State one possible reason why the acceleration changes in the way shown in the speed-time graph.</p>
<p style="display: none;">
One possible reason why the acceleration changes is that the **mass of the space probe is decreasing** as fuel is used up.
