  <h2>Forces and Motion</h2>
<div class="question">
  <h3>Question 1</h3>
  <p>The weight of a skydiver is 750N.</p>
  <img src="skydiver_diagram.png" alt="Skydiver Diagram">
  <p>The weight of the skydiver acts downwards, as shown in the diagram. While the skydiver is falling, another force acts upwards. The upward force varies as the skydiver falls.</p>
  <p>The skydiver is accelerating between time = 0 and time = 20s of the fall. Between time = 20s and time = 40s the skydiver is falling at a constant speed.</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>On the diagram, write the name of the upward force on the dotted line above the upward force.</li>
    <li>Suggest a value for the upward force on the skydiver at time = 10s.</li>
    <li>Determine the value of the upward force on the skydiver at time = 30s.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>Question 2</h3>
  <p>A sailor uses a winch to raise a sail on a boat. Diagram A shows the sailor turning the winch.</p>
  <img src="diagram_a.png" alt="Diagram A">
  <p>The sailor applies a force of 200N at a distance of 30cm from the pivot in the winch, as shown in diagram B.</p>

<div class="question">
  <h3>Question 3</h3>
  <p>The diagram shows the horizontal forces acting on a car.</p>
  <img src="car_forces_diagram.png" alt="Car Forces Diagram">
  <p>Calculate the resultant horizontal force on the car.</p>

<div class="question">
  <h3>Question 4 	</h3>
  <p>A student suspends a spring from a clamp stand and measures the length l<sub>0</sub> of the spring.</p>
  <img src="spring_diagram.png" alt="Spring Diagram">
  <p>The student then suspends loads of different weights from the spring and measures the length of the spring for each load. He then plots a graph of the length of the spring against weight.</p>
  <p>This is the graph that the student plots:</p>
  <img src="spring_graph.png" alt="Spring Graph">
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Using the graph, determine the initial length l<sub>0</sub> of the spring.</li>
    <li>State what is meant by the limit of proportionality and, using the graph, determine the weight of the load that causes this spring just to reach the limit of proportionality.</li>
    <li>Using the graph, determine the spring constant of this spring.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>Question 5</h3>
  <p>A rock climber, of total mass 62kg, holds herself in horizontal equilibrium against a vertical cliff. She pulls on a rope that is fixed at the top of the cliff and presses her feet against the cliff.</p>

  <h3>Question 7</h3>
  <p>A rock climber, of total mass 62kg, holds herself in horizontal equilibrium against a vertical cliff. She pulls on a rope that is fixed at the top of the cliff and presses her feet against the cliff.</p>
