  <h1>Cambridge A-Level Physics Notes</h1>

  <h2>Section 1: Physical Quantities and Units</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Physical Quantities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A physical quantity consists of a **numerical magnitude** and a **unit**. </li>
    <li>It's important to make **reasonable estimates** of physical quantities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 SI Units</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Base quantities** are fundamental quantities that cannot be defined in terms of other quantities. The following are the SI base quantities and their units:
      <ul>
        <li>**Mass:** kilogram (kg)</li>
        <li>**Length:** meter (m)</li>
        <li>**Time:** second (s)</li>
        <li>**Current:** ampere (A)</li>
        <li>**Temperature:** kelvin (K)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Derived units** are expressed as products or quotients of base units. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>**Velocity:** m/s (meters per second)</li>
        <li>**Force:**  kg·m/s<sup>2</sup> (kilogram meters per second squared), also known as a Newton (N)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Prefixes** are used to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of both base and derived units. The following prefixes and their symbols should be recalled and used:
      <ul>
        <li>pico (p), 10<sup>-12</sup></li>
        <li>nano (n), 10<sup>-9</sup></li>
        <li>micro (μ), 10<sup>-6</sup></li>
        <li>milli (m), 10<sup>-3</sup></li>
        <li>centi (c), 10<sup>-2</sup></li>
        <li>deci (d), 10<sup>-1</sup></li>
        <li>kilo (k), 10<sup>3</sup></li>
        <li>mega (M), 10<sup>6</sup></li>
        <li>giga (G), 10<sup>9</sup></li>
        <li>tera (T), 10<sup>12</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Homogeneity of physical equations** can be checked using SI base units. For example, in the equation for momentum (momentum = mass × velocity), the units on both sides of the equation should be the same.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Errors and Uncertainties</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Systematic errors** are consistent errors that affect all measurements in the same way. Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>**Zero errors:**  occur when a measuring instrument doesn't start at zero.</li>
        <li>**Parallax errors:** occur when measurements are read at an angle.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Random errors** are unpredictable errors that cause individual measurements to vary.</li>
    <li>**Precision** refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other.</li>
    <li>**Accuracy** refers to how close a measurement is to the true value.</li>
    <li>**Absolute uncertainty** is the amount by which a measurement may be incorrect.</li>
    <li>**Percentage uncertainty** is the absolute uncertainty expressed as a percentage of the measurement.</li>
    <li>The uncertainty in a **derived quantity** can be assessed by adding the absolute or percentage uncertainties of the individual measurements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.4 Scalars and Vectors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Scalar quantities** have only magnitude. Examples include: distance, speed, volume, mass, work done, energy, temperature, charge, voltage, and frequency.</li>
    <li>**Vector quantities** have both magnitude and direction. Examples include: displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum, force, and torque.</li>
    <li>**Adding vectors:**
        <ul>
          <li>Vectors in the same direction can be added directly.</li>
          <li>Vectors in opposite directions are subtracted.</li>
          <li>**Graphically:** using the head-to-tail method or parallelogram method.</li>
          <li>**Mathematically:** using Pythagoras' theorem for perpendicular vectors and trigonometry for vectors at any angle.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Resolving vectors:** involves breaking a vector down into its horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry.</li>
  </ul>

            <li>Can only have positive gradients.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      <ul>
        <li>\( v = u + at \)</li>
        <li>\( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \)</li>
        <li>\( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \)</li>
        <li>\( s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \)</li>
      </ul>
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li>\(s\): displacement</li>
        <li>\(u\): initial velocity</li>
        <li>\(v\): final velocity</li>
        <li>\(a\): acceleration</li>
        <li>\(t\): time</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Free fall:** is motion under the influence of gravity alone (ignoring air resistance). In this case, the acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity, \(g\), which is approximately 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 3: Dynamics</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Momentum and Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Mass** is the property of an object that resists changes in motion (inertia).</li>
    <li>**Newton's First Law of Motion:** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</li>
    <li>**Newton's Second Law of Motion:** The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it and is in the same direction as the force.
      <ul>
        <li>This can be expressed mathematically as \(F = ma\), where:
          <ul>
            <li>\(F\): resultant force</li>
            <li>\(m\): mass</li>
            <li>\(a\): acceleration</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The unit of force is the Newton (N), which is defined as 1 kg·m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Weight** is the force of gravity on an object and is calculated using \(W = mg\), where:

        <li>\(m\): mass</li>
        <li>\(g\): acceleration due to gravity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Newton's Third Law of Motion:** When two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. These forces are of the same type.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Non-Uniform Motion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Frictional forces** and **viscous/drag forces** (including air resistance) oppose motion.</li>
    <li>When an object moves against a resistive force, it may reach a **terminal velocity**, where the resistive force equals the driving force, resulting in zero net force and constant velocity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Linear Momentum and its Conservation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Linear momentum (p)** is the product of mass and velocity: \(p = mv\).</li>
    <li>**Impulse** is the change in momentum of an object.
      <ul>
        <li>It can be calculated as the product of force and time: Impulse = \(Ft\).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Principle of conservation of momentum:** The total momentum of a closed system remains constant, provided no external forces act on the system. This applies to both elastic and inelastic collisions, as well as explosions.</li>
    <li>**Elastic collision:** kinetic energy is conserved.</li>
    <li>**Inelastic collision:** kinetic energy is not conserved.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>**Couple** is a pair of forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and parallel to each other, but not along the same line of action.
      <ul>
        <li>Couples produce only rotation, not linear motion.</li>
        <li>The **torque of a couple** is calculated using \(torque = force × perpendicular distance between the forces\).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 Equilibrium of Forces</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Principle of moments:** For a system in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any point equals the sum of the counterclockwise moments about the same point.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>**Archimedes' principle:** states that the upthrust on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.</li>
        <li>Upthrust can be calculated using \(F = ρgV\), where:
          <ul>
            <li>\(F\): upthrust</li>
