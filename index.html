		<h2>1.1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Techniques</h2>
		<p>In this section, we will discuss the different physical quantities used in measurements, such as mass, length, time, temperature, and others. The various units of measurement like SI units will also be covered.</p>

		<h3>Measurement Techniques</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Use of rulers and measuring cylinders:</strong>
				<div class="note">A ruler is used to measure straight lengths, typically in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). A measuring cylinder is used for measuring the volume of liquids, marked with graduations to indicate volume in milliliters (mL) or liters (L).</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Measuring time intervals:</strong>
				<div class="note">Clocks and digital timers are used to measure time intervals. Clocks can measure time in hours, minutes, and seconds, while digital timers provide more precise measurements in seconds or fractions of a second.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Average value for a distance and time interval:</strong>
				<div class="note">To find an average, measure multiple values for distance or time, then divide the total by the number of measurements. For example, use a pendulum’s period to calculate average time intervals.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Scalar and Vector Quantities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Scalar quantities:</strong>
				<div class="note">Scalars have magnitude (size) only and no direction. Examples: distance, speed, time, mass, energy, temperature.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Vector quantities:</strong>
				<div class="note">Vectors have both magnitude and direction. Examples: force, weight, velocity, acceleration, momentum, electric field strength, gravitational field strength.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Vector Calculations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Resultant of two vectors at right angles:</strong>
				<div class="note">To find the resultant of two vectors at right angles (e.g., forces or velocities), use the Pythagorean theorem. For two vectors, \(A\) and \(B\), the resultant \(R\) is: 
				<br> \(R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are the magnitudes of the two vectors.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>1.2 Motion</h2>
		<p>In this section, we will define and calculate the key concepts of speed, velocity, acceleration, and the various graphs associated with these quantities.</p>

		<h3>Speed and Velocity</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Speed:</strong>
				<div class="note">Speed is defined as the distance travelled per unit time. The formula used is: 
				\[
				\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
				\]
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Velocity:</strong>
				<div class="note">Velocity is defined as speed in a given direction. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Average Speed:</strong>
				<div class="note">The average speed is calculated as the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken. The formula is:
				\[
				\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
				\]
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Distance–Time and Speed–Time Graphs</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong>
				<div class="note">Sketch, plot, and interpret distance–time and speed–time graphs to understand the motion of objects. Key points to note:
				<ul>
					<li>At rest: The graph is a horizontal line.</li>
					<li>Constant speed: The graph is a straight, non-horizontal line with a constant gradient.</li>
					<li>Acceleration: The graph has an increasing gradient.</li>
					<li>Deceleration: The graph has a decreasing gradient.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Calculate Speed from Distance–Time Graph:</strong>
				<div class="note">To calculate speed from a distance–time graph, determine the gradient of a straight-line section of the graph.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Calculate Distance from Speed–Time Graph:</strong>
				<div class="note">The area under a speed–time graph represents the distance travelled. For motion with constant speed or constant acceleration, this can be calculated easily using geometric shapes.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Acceleration</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Acceleration of Free Fall:</strong>
				<div class="note">The acceleration of free fall (\(g\)) for an object near the Earth's surface is approximately constant and has a value of approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Definition of Acceleration:</strong>
				<div class="note">Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per unit time. The formula used is:
				\[
				a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
				\]
				where \(a\) is acceleration, \(\Delta v\) is the change in velocity, and \(\Delta t\) is the change in time.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Constant and Changing Acceleration:</strong>
				<div class="note">From given data or a speed–time graph, you can determine when an object is moving with constant or changing acceleration:
				<ul>
					<li>Constant acceleration: The graph has a straight line with a constant gradient.</li>
					<li>Changing acceleration: The graph's gradient changes over time.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Calculate Acceleration from Speed–Time Graph:</strong>
				<div class="note">The acceleration can be calculated by finding the gradient of a speed–time graph.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Deceleration:</strong>
				<div class="note">Deceleration is a negative acceleration and can be used in calculations just like positive acceleration.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Objects Falling in a Gravitational Field</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Motion in a Gravitational Field:</strong>
				<div class="note">The motion of objects falling in a uniform gravitational field can be described with or without air or liquid resistance. Without resistance, the object accelerates at \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\). With resistance, the object eventually reaches terminal velocity, where the force due to gravity equals the drag force, resulting in no further acceleration.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Example LaTeX inline equation -->
		<p>For example, the formula for speed is \( v = \frac{d}{t} \), where \( v \) is velocity, \( d \) is distance, and \( t \) is time.</p>

		<!-- Example LaTeX display equation -->
		<p>Also, the following is an example of an equation displayed:</p>
		<p>\[
			a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
		\]</p>

		<h3>Equations of Motion</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Equation 1: \( v = u + at \)</strong>
				<div class="note">This equation describes the final velocity (\(v\)) of an object when it starts with an initial velocity (\(u\)), accelerates at a rate of \(a\) for a time \(t\).</div>
				<div class="example">Example: An object starts from rest (i.e., \(u = 0\)) and accelerates at \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\) for 5 seconds. The final velocity is:
				\[
				v = 0 + (2 \times 5) = 10 \, \text{m/s}
				\]</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Equation 2: \( S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \)</strong>
				<div class="note">This equation calculates the displacement (\(S\)) of an object when it starts with an initial velocity (\(u\)), accelerates at \(a\) for a time \(t\).</div>
				<div class="example">Example: A car starts from rest (\(u = 0\)) and accelerates at \(3 \, \text{m/s}^2\) for 4 seconds. The displacement is:
				\[
				S = (0 \times 4) + 0.5 \times 3 \times 4^2 = 0 + 0.5 \times 3 \times 16 = 24 \, \text{m}
				\]</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Equation 3: \( v^2 = u^2 + 2aS \)</strong>
				<div class="note">This equation relates the final velocity squared (\(v^2\)) to the initial velocity squared (\(u^2\)), acceleration (\(a\)), and displacement (\(S\)).</div>
				<div class="example">Example: A car accelerates from \(u = 5 \, \text{m/s}\) to \(v = 15 \, \text{m/s}\) with an acceleration of \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\). The displacement is:
				\[
				v^2 = u^2 + 2aS \quad \Rightarrow \quad 15^2 = 5^2 + 2 \times 2 \times S
				\]
				\[
				225 = 25 + 4S \quad \Rightarrow \quad 200 = 4S \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = 50 \, \text{m}
				\]</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Applications of Equations of Motion</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Solving Problems:</strong>
				<div class="note">These equations are widely used to solve problems involving motion with constant acceleration. For example, to find the final velocity or displacement of an object in free fall or an object moving with constant acceleration, you can use these equations depending on the known quantities.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Example LaTeX inline equation -->
		<p>For example, the first equation of motion is \( v = u + at \), where \( v \) is the final velocity, \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( t \) is the time.</p>

		<!-- Example LaTeX display equation -->
		<p>Also, the following are examples of the other two equations of motion:</p>
		<p>\[
			S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
		\]</p>
		<p>\[
			v^2 = u^2 + 2aS
		\]</p>

			<h2>1.3 Mass and Weight</h2>
			
			<p><strong>Mass:</strong> Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object at rest relative to the observer. It is constant and does not change regardless of location.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object with mass. It depends on the gravitational field strength and varies based on location.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Gravitational Field Strength:</strong> Defined as the force per unit mass. It is expressed as:</p>
			<p>\[
				g = \frac{W}{m}
			\]</p>
			<p>This equation is equivalent to the acceleration due to free fall, which on Earth is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} \).</p>

			<p>Weights and masses can be compared using a balance. For example, a spring balance measures weight, while a beam balance measures mass by comparison to standard weights.</p>

			<p>Weight is the effect of a gravitational field on a mass. The strength of the gravitational field (\( g \)) can be found by plotting a graph of weight against mass. The gradient of this graph gives the value of \( g \).</p>

			<h3>Graph of Weight Against Mass</h3>
			<p><em>Plot the graph, calculate the gradient, and interpret the result as the gravitational field strength.</em></p>
			
			<h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Weight, mass, and gravitational field strength are related through the equation \( W = mg \).</li>
				<li>Gravitational field strength near Earth’s surface is constant at \( 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} \).</li>
				<li>All objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity in free fall, but air resistance can alter their motion.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Activity: Weight on Different Planets</h3>
			<p>Stick images of the planets with their gravitational field strength values around the classroom. Learners can use these values to calculate their weight on different planets using the formula \( W = mg \).</p>
			<p>For example, if a learner's mass is \( 60 \, \text{kg} \):</p>
			<p>\[
				W_{\text{Mars}} = 60 \times 3.7 = 222 \, \text{N}
			\]</p>

			<h3>Discussion: How Sports Records Might Change</h3>
			<p>Discuss how Olympic records for weightlifting, high jump, and sprints would differ on Mars due to its lower gravitational field strength. Learners estimate the potential changes.</p>

			<h3>Advanced Topics</h3>
			<p><strong>Gravitational Fields:</strong> A gravitational field is a region where a mass experiences a force due to gravitational attraction. The strength of this field depends on the size of the mass creating it and the distance from it.</p>

			<p><strong>Newton’s Law of Gravitation:</strong> For advanced learners, introduce the equation:</p>
			<p>\[
				F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
			\]</p>
			<p>Where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are masses, and \( r \) is the distance between them.</p>

			<h3>Interactive Simulation</h3>
			<p>Learners can explore gravitational attraction using the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/gravity-force-lab-basics" target="_blank">Gravity Force Lab Simulation</a>. They calculate forces between objects and understand why gravitational forces between small masses go unnoticed.</p>

    <h2>1.4 Density</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition of Density:</strong> Density is defined as mass per unit volume. It indicates how closely packed the particles of a substance are. The formula for density is:</p>
    <p>\[
        \rho = \frac{m}{v}
    \]</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \rho \) = density (kg/m<sup>3</sup> or g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</li>
        <li>\( m \) = mass (kg or g)</li>
        <li>\( v \) = volume (m<sup>3</sup> or cm<sup>3</sup>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Determining Density</h3>
    <p><strong>1. For a Liquid:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the mass of an empty measuring cylinder.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid into the cylinder and measure its total mass.</li>
        <li>Subtract the empty cylinder’s mass to find the liquid’s mass.</li>
        <li>Record the liquid’s volume from the cylinder.</li>
        <li>Use the formula \( \rho = \frac{m}{v} \).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>2. For a Regularly Shaped Solid:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the mass of the solid using a balance.</li>
        <li>Determine its volume using geometric formulas (e.g., \( v = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \) for a cuboid).</li>
        <li>Use the formula \( \rho = \frac{m}{v} \).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>3. For an Irregularly Shaped Solid:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the mass of the solid using a balance.</li>
        <li>Fill a measuring cylinder with water and note the initial volume.</li>
        <li>Submerge the solid in the water and record the new volume.</li>
        <li>Calculate the volume of the solid as the difference between the initial and final volumes.</li>
        <li>Use the formula \( \rho = \frac{m}{v} \).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Floating and Sinking</h3>
    <p><strong>Objects:</strong> An object will float if its density is less than the density of the liquid it is placed in. Otherwise, it will sink.</p>
    <p><strong>Liquids:</strong> When two immiscible liquids are mixed, the one with lower density will float on top of the denser liquid. Examples include oil on water or fresh water on saltwater.</p>

    <h3>Converting Units</h3>
    <p>To convert between g/cm<sup>3</sup> and kg/m<sup>3</sup>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Practical Activity: Investigating Density</h3>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/buoyancy" target="_blank">Buoyancy Simulation</a> to explore the principles of density and floating. Try stacking liquids of different densities and observe how they layer.</p>

    <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1:</strong> A metal block has a mass of 540 g and a volume of 200 cm<sup>3</sup>. Calculate its density.</li></br>
        <li><strong>Q2:</strong> If 50 ml of a liquid weighs 40 g, determine its density.</li></br>
        <li><strong>Q3:</strong> Will an object with a density of 800 kg/m<sup>3</sup> float in water? Justify your answer.</li></br>
        <li><strong>Q4:</strong> Oil has a density of 0.92 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and water has a density of 1.00 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Which liquid will float on top?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A1:</strong> 
            \[
            \rho = \frac{m}{v} = \frac{540 \, \text{g}}{200 \, \text{cm}^3} = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3
            \] 
        </li></br>
        <li><strong>A2:</strong> 
            \[
            \rho = \frac{m}{v} = \frac{40 \, \text{g}}{50 \, \text{ml}} = 0.8 \, \text{g/cm}^3
            \]
        </li></br>
        <li><strong>A3:</strong> The object will float since its density (\( 800 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)) is less than the density of water (\( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)).</li></br>
        <li><strong>A4:</strong> Oil will float on water because its density (\( 0.92 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \)) is less than water’s density (\( 1.00 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \)).</li>

    <h2>1.5 Forces</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition of Force:</strong> A force is a push or pull acting on an object as a result of its interaction with another object. Forces can change an object’s shape, speed, or direction of motion.</p>

    <h3>Types of Forces</h3>
    <p><strong>Contact Forces:</strong> These forces occur when objects are physically touching each other.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frictional Force: Resists motion between two surfaces in contact.</li>
        <li>Tension Force: Force transmitted through a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled tight.</li>
        <li>Normal Force: The support force exerted by a surface on an object resting on it.</li>
        <li>Air Resistance: Force acting against a moving object in air.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Non-Contact Forces:</strong> These forces act at a distance without physical contact.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gravitational Force: Attraction between two masses.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Force: Attraction or repulsion between magnetic poles.</li>
        <li>Electrostatic Force: Force between electrically charged objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Net Force</h3>
    <p>When multiple forces act on an object, the net force is the vector sum of all these forces. It determines the overall effect on the object’s motion.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( F_{\text{net}} = F_1 + F_2 + \dots + F_n \), considering the direction of each force.</p>

    <h3>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</h3>
    <p><strong>Balanced Forces:</strong> If the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the net force is zero. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The object remains stationary or continues to move at a constant velocity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Condition for Balanced Forces:</strong></p>
    <p>\[
        F_{\text{net}} = 0
    \]</p>

    <p><strong>Unbalanced Forces:</strong> If the forces acting on an object do not cancel out, the net force is non-zero, causing the object to accelerate in the direction of the net force.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Net Force Calculations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Two forces of 5 N and 7 N act in the same direction on an object. Find the net force.</li></br>
        <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Two forces of 10 N and 6 N act on an object in opposite directions. Find the net force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1:</strong> A box is pulled with a force of 15 N to the right and 10 N to the left. What is the net force acting on the box?</li></br>
        <li><strong>Q2:</strong> An object is stationary under the influence of two forces, 20 N upwards and 20 N downwards. Is the object in equilibrium? Why?</li></br>
        <li><strong>Q3:</strong> Two children push a toy car with forces of 12 N and 8 N in the same direction. Calculate the net force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A1:</strong> Net force = \( 15 \, \text{N} - 10 \, \text{N} = 5 \, \text{N} \) to the right.</li></br>
        <li><strong>A2:</strong> Yes, the object is in equilibrium because the forces are balanced (\( 20 \, \text{N} - 20 \, \text{N} = 0 \)).</li></br>
        <li><strong>A3:</strong> Net force = \( 12 \, \text{N} + 8 \, \text{N} = 20 \, \text{N} \) in the same direction.</li>
    </ul></br>

		<h2>1.5.1 Effects of forces</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>1. Resultant Forces</h3>
				<p>The resultant force is the single force that has the same effect as the combined forces acting on an object along the same straight line.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If forces act in the <strong>same direction</strong>, add their magnitudes.</li>
					<li>If forces act in <strong>opposite directions</strong>, subtract the smaller force from the larger.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Newton’s First Law:</strong> An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a resultant force. If the resultant force is zero, the object is in <strong>equilibrium</strong>.</p>

				<p><strong>Newton’s Second Law:</strong> A resultant force causes acceleration:
					<br>
						\[ F = ma \]
					</p>
				<p>The direction of the force and acceleration is the same.</p>

				<h3>2. Types of Forces</h3>
				<p>Forces can be classified into two main categories:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Contact Forces:</strong> Forces that require physical contact. Examples include friction, air resistance, tension, and normal force.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-Contact Forces:</strong> Forces that act without physical contact. Examples include gravity, magnetic force, and electrostatic force.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>3. Friction and Drag</h3>
				<p><strong>Friction:</strong> Acts between surfaces in contact, opposing motion and producing heat.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Solid Friction:</strong> Between two surfaces in contact.</li>
					<li><strong>Drag (Air Resistance):</strong> Acts on objects moving through a fluid, such as air or water.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Terminal Velocity:</strong> This occurs when the force of air resistance equals the force of gravity, resulting in no net force and constant velocity.</p>

				<h3>4. Hooke’s Law</h3>
				<p><strong>Hooke's Law:</strong> Describes the extension of a spring under a load:</p>
				<p>\[F = kx \], where:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>F = Force applied,</li>
					<li>k = Spring constant,</li>
					<li>x = Extension.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Limit of Proportionality:</strong> The point beyond which Hooke’s Law is no longer valid.</p>

				<h2>Practice Questions</h2>
				<h3>1. Resultant Force</h3>
				<p>Two forces of 10 N and 15 N act on a box in opposite directions. Find the resultant force.</p>

				<h3>2. Hooke’s Law</h3>
				<p>A spring stretches by 0.05 m under a 2 N force. Calculate the spring constant.</p>

				<h3>3. Friction and Drag</h3>
				<p>Explain why a spacecraft heats up upon re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere.</p></br>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
    <h2>Answers</h2>
    <h3>1. Resultant Force</h3>
    <p>The two forces act in opposite directions. The resultant force is the difference between the magnitudes of the forces:</p>
    <p>\[ F_{\text{resultant}} = F_1 - F_2 = 15\, \text{N} - 10 \text{N} = 5\, \text{N} \] 
    The resultant force is 5 N in the direction of the larger force.</p></br>

    <h3>2. Hooke’s Law</h3>
    <p>Hooke’s Law states: \[ F = k \cdot x \]</p>
    <p>Rearranging to find the spring constant (\( k \)):</p>
    <p>\[ k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{2\, \text{N}}{0.05\, \text{m}} = 40\, \text{N/m} \]</p>
    <p>The spring constant is \( 40\, \text{N/m} \).</p></br>

    <h3>3. Friction and Drag</h3>
    <p>A spacecraft heats up upon re-entry because of air resistance. The drag force causes compression of air in front of the spacecraft, generating heat through friction and compression. This results in extremely high temperatures.</p></br>
