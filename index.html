        <div class="topic-box" id="topic1.1">
    <h2>1.1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Techniques</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will discuss the different physical quantities used in measurements, such as mass, length, time, temperature, and others. The various units of measurement like SI units will also be covered.</p>

    <h3>Measurement Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use of rulers and measuring cylinders:</strong>
            <div class="note">A ruler is used to measure straight lengths, typically in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). A measuring cylinder is used for measuring the volume of liquids, marked with graduations to indicate volume in milliliters (mL) or liters (L).</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Measuring time intervals:</strong>
            <div class="note">Clocks and digital timers are used to measure time intervals. Clocks can measure time in hours, minutes, and seconds, while digital timers provide more precise measurements in seconds or fractions of a second.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Average value for a distance and time interval:</strong>
            <div class="note">To find an average, measure multiple values for distance or time, then divide the total by the number of measurements. For example, use a pendulum’s period to calculate average time intervals.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scalar and Vector Quantities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalar quantities:</strong>
            <div class="note">Scalars have magnitude (size) only and no direction. Examples: distance, speed, time, mass, energy, temperature.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vector quantities:</strong>
            <div class="note">Vectors have both magnitude and direction. Examples: force, weight, velocity, acceleration, momentum, electric field strength, gravitational field strength.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vector Calculations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resultant of two vectors at right angles:</strong>
            <div class="note">To find the resultant of two vectors at right angles (e.g., forces or velocities), use the Pythagorean theorem. For two vectors, \(A\) and \(B\), the resultant \(R\) is: 
            <br> \(R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are the magnitudes of the two vectors.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>
	</div>

            <div class="topic-box" id="topic1.2">
    <h2>1.2 Motion</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will define and calculate the key concepts of speed, velocity, acceleration, and the various graphs associated with these quantities.</p>

    <h3>Speed and Velocity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong>
            <div class="note">Speed is defined as the distance travelled per unit time. The formula used is: 
            \[
            \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
            \]
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Velocity:</strong>
            <div class="note">Velocity is defined as speed in a given direction. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Average Speed:</strong>
            <div class="note">The average speed is calculated as the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken. The formula is:
            \[
            \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
            \]
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distance–Time and Speed–Time Graphs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong>
            <div class="note">Sketch, plot, and interpret distance–time and speed–time graphs to understand the motion of objects. Key points to note:
            <ul>
                <li>At rest: The graph is a horizontal line.</li>
                <li>Constant speed: The graph is a straight, non-horizontal line with a constant gradient.</li>
                <li>Acceleration: The graph has an increasing gradient.</li>
                <li>Deceleration: The graph has a decreasing gradient.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Speed from Distance–Time Graph:</strong>
            <div class="note">To calculate speed from a distance–time graph, determine the gradient of a straight-line section of the graph.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Distance from Speed–Time Graph:</strong>
            <div class="note">The area under a speed–time graph represents the distance travelled. For motion with constant speed or constant acceleration, this can be calculated easily using geometric shapes.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acceleration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acceleration of Free Fall:</strong>
            <div class="note">The acceleration of free fall (\(g\)) for an object near the Earth's surface is approximately constant and has a value of approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Definition of Acceleration:</strong>
            <div class="note">Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per unit time. The formula used is:
            \[
            a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
            \]
            where \(a\) is acceleration, \(\Delta v\) is the change in velocity, and \(\Delta t\) is the change in time.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Constant and Changing Acceleration:</strong>
            <div class="note">From given data or a speed–time graph, you can determine when an object is moving with constant or changing acceleration:
            <ul>
                <li>Constant acceleration: The graph has a straight line with a constant gradient.</li>
                <li>Changing acceleration: The graph's gradient changes over time.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Acceleration from Speed–Time Graph:</strong>
            <div class="note">The acceleration can be calculated by finding the gradient of a speed–time graph.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deceleration:</strong>
            <div class="note">Deceleration is a negative acceleration and can be used in calculations just like positive acceleration.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Objects Falling in a Gravitational Field</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motion in a Gravitational Field:</strong>
            <div class="note">The motion of objects falling in a uniform gravitational field can be described with or without air or liquid resistance. Without resistance, the object accelerates at \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\). With resistance, the object eventually reaches terminal velocity, where the force due to gravity equals the drag force, resulting in no further acceleration.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Example LaTeX inline equation -->
    <p>For example, the formula for speed is \( v = \frac{d}{t} \), where \( v \) is velocity, \( d \) is distance, and \( t \) is time.</p>

    <!-- Example LaTeX display equation -->
    <p>Also, the following is an example of an equation displayed:</p>
    <p>\[
        a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
    \]</p>

    <h3>Equations of Motion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equation 1: \( v = u + at \)</strong>
            <div class="note">This equation describes the final velocity (\(v\)) of an object when it starts with an initial velocity (\(u\)), accelerates at a rate of \(a\) for a time \(t\).</div>
            <div class="example">Example: An object starts from rest (i.e., \(u = 0\)) and accelerates at \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\) for 5 seconds. The final velocity is:
            \[
            v = 0 + (2 \times 5) = 10 \, \text{m/s}
            \]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equation 2: \( S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \)</strong>
            <div class="note">This equation calculates the displacement (\(S\)) of an object when it starts with an initial velocity (\(u\)), accelerates at \(a\) for a time \(t\).</div>
            <div class="example">Example: A car starts from rest (\(u = 0\)) and accelerates at \(3 \, \text{m/s}^2\) for 4 seconds. The displacement is:
            \[
            S = (0 \times 4) + 0.5 \times 3 \times 4^2 = 0 + 0.5 \times 3 \times 16 = 24 \, \text{m}
            \]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equation 3: \( v^2 = u^2 + 2aS \)</strong>
            <div class="note">This equation relates the final velocity squared (\(v^2\)) to the initial velocity squared (\(u^2\)), acceleration (\(a\)), and displacement (\(S\)).</div>
            <div class="example">Example: A car accelerates from \(u = 5 \, \text{m/s}\) to \(v = 15 \, \text{m/s}\) with an acceleration of \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\). The displacement is:
            \[
            v^2 = u^2 + 2aS \quad \Rightarrow \quad 15^2 = 5^2 + 2 \times 2 \times S
            \]
            \[
            225 = 25 + 4S \quad \Rightarrow \quad 200 = 4S \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = 50 \, \text{m}
            \]</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications of Equations of Motion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solving Problems:</strong>
            <div class="note">These equations are widely used to solve problems involving motion with constant acceleration. For example, to find the final velocity or displacement of an object in free fall or an object moving with constant acceleration, you can use these equations depending on the known quantities.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Example LaTeX inline equation -->
    <p>For example, the first equation of motion is \( v = u + at \), where \( v \) is the final velocity, \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( t \) is the time.</p>

    <!-- Example LaTeX display equation -->
    <p>Also, the following are examples of the other two equations of motion:</p>
    <p>\[
        S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
    \]</p>
    <p>\[
        v^2 = u^2 + 2aS
